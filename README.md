## Project Description

This project integrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model with OCR techniques to automate the recognition of handwritten medical prescriptions. 

### Features:
- Text recognition using Tesseract OCR.
- Prediction of prescription details using a trained CNN model.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy usage.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Download the project files from your version control or copy them to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Medical Scripts
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the environment:
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the Application

Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Steps:

1. **Launch the Web App**:
   The app will open in your default browser.

2. **Upload or Capture an Image**:
   - Upload an image file of a medical prescription.
   - Alternatively, use the camera input to capture an image.

3. **Process the Image**:
   - Perform OCR to extract handwritten text.
   - Use the pre-trained CNN model to predict specific prescription details.

4. **View Results**:
   - Extracted text is displayed in a text area.
   - Predictions from the CNN model are shown below the extracted text.

5. **Save or Download Results**:
   - Download the OCR results as a `.txt` file.
